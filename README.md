# Textadventure
A Python game in a textconsole

I recently decided to clean up software I made in school like this Textadventure.
You can move around in a schoolbuilding and complete tasks.

I was too lazy for Git and now I managed to delete some narrative.
Fortunately it wasn't up to date but I still decided to use Git from now on to prevent bad stuff from happening.
